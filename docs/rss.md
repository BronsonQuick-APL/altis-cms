# RSS Feed

RSS Feed (“Rich Site Summary” or “Really Simple Syndication”) is type of web feed that provides users and applications with regular updates from a given website. The RSS feed is a structured XML code document.

By default RSS Feed is enabled. If you wish to disable it, set the `rss` configuration property to `false`

```json
{
	"extra": {
		"altis": {
			"modules": {
				"cms": {
					"rss": false
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```
